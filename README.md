## Overview and Origin

![Empower.eco logo](https://empower.eco/assets/update-before-christmas/logo.svg)

* Name of company: 
  * Empower.eco

* When was the company incorporated? 
  * January 2018

* Who are the founders of the company?
  * Wilhelm Myrer (CEO/Founder)
  * Gjermund Bjaanes (CTO/Founder)

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
  * Based on the idea of using new technology to enable a circular economy, Empower was created with the vision to empower people to create a cleaner and better world. Empower is building a global plastic waste ecosystem based on the same philosophy as the Norwegian bottle deposit system. By giving plastic waste a value they plan to both stop leakage of plastic into the environment, and cost-efficiently incentivize collection of leaked waste. By tracking plastic waste and making digital inventories, Empower also ensures that the most of it is reused and recycled.  [Empower.eco](empower.eco/about)

  * Angel investor seed funding announced 18 Oct 2018. Amount received undisclosed. Investing round led by TheFactory, a premier Nordic fintech and proptech accelerator and incubator. [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/empower-angel--16917d57#section-investors)

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
  * Empower is trying to solve the issue of growing plastic waste by financially incentivizing the collection and delivery of plastics to their partner recycling stations.  

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
  * While Empower does provide service donation plans to individuals and companies looking to reduce their plastic footprint on the environment, Empower mainly targets low-income North African and Indo-Pacific countries and their port cities for their collection projects. These cities have large plastic waste reserves, little to no recycling capacity, and can be easily incentivized to collect plastic for the Empower program.
  * More than $10 billion of bulk value plastic waste ends up in nature every year. Feeding plastic waste into the circular economy and creating recycled products, meanwhile, could have a potential value of $50 billion. This is the potential market share that Empower and other waste management technology companies are trying to disrupt.  Empower’s system has been piloted in over 15 countries and has already established permanent recycling stations in and agreements with several other countries as well.

  * Empower provides various plans to companies and individuals seeking to reduce their plastic footprint, these plans fund Empower's waste management projects - funding low income country plastic recovery and recycling, while creating local jobs and financial growth.

**Programs**

1. Plastic Positive Company Plan: $5/month per employee. Enables a company to state their 'green impact' and allows employees to follow which projects their contributions support through Empower's system.

2. Product-Impact Plan: Pricing varies with scope of a company's partnership with Empower. Plan is intended to support companies looking for a method to offset their production plastic footprint.

3. Customise Service Plan: Pricing varies with scope of plan. This plan is intended to draw innovation and pilot projects with companies that want to coordinate plastic waste solutions that go beyond the scope of the previous two plans.

4. Individual Contributions: Individuals can contribute directly to Empower to support plastic waste collection programs and offset their own personal plastic footprint. Categories include Plastic Neutral ($3), Plastic Positive ($5), Plastic Hero ($10) and other custom amounts allocated as a monthly or one time contribution.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
  * Empower uses a blockchain-enabled system that allows people to exchange plastic  waste for tokens. These tokens can then be exchanged for local currency or be used to pay for plastic clean-up in other locations.
  * The system lets anyone deliver plastic waste at certified recycling stations. Distributed ledger technology ensures that tokens for plastic are securely awarded and used. The plastic waste is digitally registered at collection, allowing for a transparent and traceable waste management system where everyone can see where the collected plastic ends up. Empower is working to pilot the waste tracking component with plastic waste collectors, waste management companies and buyers of recycled plastic in order to fully implement the system.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
  * Waste management through tokenized assets.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
  * **Plastic Based Micro-Loans:**
  * Vestre and Empower are planning to run a pilot for micro loans secured by plastic waste collection. Vestre is a Scandinavian industrial company that focuses on developing and manufacturing sustainable design furniture for private and public urban environments. The pilot project will take place in Laos in cooperation with Aay’s Village, an NGO that is already running an Empower collection point in the jungle village with successful results - cleaning up more than 50,000 bottles in two months.
  * During the new pilot, plastic will be collected and delivered to the collection point and the plastic collectors who register their deposit in the Empower App will build up a revenue track record and credit score. This score together with the digital tokens that they earn in return for the collected plastic will enable local entrepreneurs to get access to micro loans that are repayable in plastic waste.
  * Empower will provide the digital solution while Vestre is funding the initial credit facility. The joint goal is to empower local entrepreneurs with the resources to create new jobs and new businesses while keeping incentivizing efficient and transparent clean-up of plastic waste.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
  * Canadian company Plastic Bank, who is in operation in Haiti and Peru, utilizes a blockchain solution to reduce plastic waste. The company has strategically located recycling centers where people take their waste, such as empty plastic water bottles, cups, and bags in exchange for digital tokens secured via a blockchain platform and can be redeemed for food or charging phones. All the plastic collected is then sold to a buyer for recycling purposes. This is slightly different from Empower in that they provide a credit for use in other target services, instead of providing a cash-out option. 
  * Miglianico, an Italian town, local government implemented a similar idea through a blockchain-powered “Pay as You Throw” (PAYT) model, the town has been able to enhance waste management as the annual cost of waste collection has decreased by over 65%. Town residents are credited back for their household recycling contributions. Miglianico uses both the blockchain-powered PAYT model and radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags pegged on sacks and bins. Collection staff is offered wristbands for scanning residents' waste. This approach has enabled the town to increase their waste management efficiency by 85%.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
  * Blockchain technology and digital ledger networks offer the ability to track waste management in real-time. This makes it easier to track recycling and waste shipments and assist local governments in implementing better waste management regulatory compliance.
  * Digital tokens provide the economic incentive for developing countries and low-income communities to properly recycle their plastic waste and contribute to the circular economy.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
  * A primary core metric is the amount (metric-tones) of plastic recycling that these waste management companies are able to collect and contribute to the circular economy. This is driven by the partnerships they establish at processing centers, local communities and local governments. 
  * Approved pilot programs and new partnerships is one piece in the puzzle for these companies, program success also depends heavily on the community involvement and the cost-benefit of providing a tokenized financial incentive. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
  * Empower is currently operating in over 15 countries and has funded the cleanup of over 86,000 kg of plastic and other recyclable waste. Relative to competitors, Empower seems to have a larger portfolio of projects spanning mostly in North African and Indo-pacific regions. 
  * The fact that more local governments are considering payment-incentivised waste management and/or recycling pilot projects also prove the influence Empower and other similar companies are having on disrupting traditional waste collection services.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
  * A strong partnership for financially incentivised waste management companies like Empower can utilize is with local public transportation providers. Having collection centers provide a token asset that can be used to purchase or 'top-up' their local transportation charge card will be a major incentive to low-income communities to collect and properly recycle waste as well as support local public transportation. This partnership, when presented to local governments and municipalities as a pilot project, will enable Empower to appeal to community needs and greater incentivize the local government cooperation. 
  * The funding for these community projects should be offset, a least partially, by a tax or fee on major polluting or waste heavy industries in the local area. Funding for local waste management that is saved through a more public-focused collection alternative must be reallocated into this pilot project in order to sustain long term operations.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
  * Offering the service partnership can benefit the company by creating a more complete service package to local communities. Most communities want more public transportation but struggle to find the appropriate funding. This service cooperation will draw more pilot projects and long standing partnerships as low-income communities can benefit both from a more efficient waste management process and more user-based funding for their public transportation systems. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
  * Proper IT infrastructure and communications infrastructure that allows the Empower network to initiate and reflect a transfer of funds into a local public transportation service charge card is required to ensure the large scale adaptability of this partnership process. The token exchange needs to be backed by a stable currency to ensure public trust and protect against high and uncontrolled volatility. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
  * Funding for direct cash incentives can only be supported for a limited amount of time. Even with Empower's industry partnership subscription service and processing fee it takes from providing services to waste processing centers. The scalability is limited unless other community based services can be included to provide a more sustainable circular-economy business model. 
  * Moreover, innovation to plastic waste collection and recycling management is only one part of the massive plastic industry that produces over 300 million tons of plastic every year, with 50% dedicated for single-use purposes.
